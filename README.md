### Running the application
The app uses Laravel Sail to setup the dev environment. You must have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)) installed in order to run the project. With docker installed, `cd` into the app directory and run `./vendor/bin/sail up`.

Once the application's Docker containers have been started, you can access the application in your web browser at: http://localhost.
